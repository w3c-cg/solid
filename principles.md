# Principles

*This is an early draft and currently it does NOT represent a rough consensus,
please use the issue tracker to iteratively improve it*

* The mission of the Solid CG is to provide a home for incubation
  of proposals related to Solid.
* The CG is not a standards group. It is not the CG's role to determine
  "what is suitable for Solid."
* The fact that the Solid CG provides a home for incubation does not mean
  that the CG endorses any particular proposal, nor guarantee that any
  particular proposal will be subsequently adopted by another group.
* The Solid CG is an inclusive forum where diverse ideas are shared
  and debated respectfully (consistent with codes of conduct).
* Early feedback on proposals should focus on clarifications. Statements of
  opposition should be reserved for later stages of incubation.
