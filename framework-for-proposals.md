# Framework for proposals

*This is an early draft and currently it does NOT represent a rough consensus,
please use the issue tracker to iteratively improve it*


## New suggestion

Must include a problem statement and use cases. At
this point, all that is sought is expressions of shared interest
or questions of clarification. Commenters must not, at this stage:
* Critique the problem statement or use cases (e.g., saying, "This is not related to Solid.").
* Discourage further expressions of interest (e.g., saying, "It's too soon for this discussion.").

The proponent may ask the Chairs to put the topic on the CG's
meeting agenda for an introduction, to gauge interest, invite
collaborators, and ask clarifying questions. The Chairs may add the
topic to the agenda at their discretion, or they may ask for the
proponents to do additional work before putting it on the agenda.


## Requirements

After detecting shared interest (e.g., some number
of people from different organizations say "I'm interested in
this" on the GitHub thread), the proponent and any
collaborators begin documenting requirements for addressing the
problem statement and use cases. At this point, CG participants
may ask questions about the requirements and may provide feedback
to improve their clarity and precision.


## Proposal

After detecting sufficient support for a set of requirements,
the proponent can write up a proposal, including their views on
how the proposal addresses the problem statement, use cases, and
requirements. Early implementation of the proposal is welcome but
not required. At this point, feedback should be limited to comments
on whether the proposal addresses the problem statement, use cases,
and requirements. Alternative proposals (all including their own
views on problem statement, use cases, and requirements) are welcome.
At any time, the CG Chairs may organize discussion to help people
understand proposals, ask questions, etc.


## Traction

At some point, it may become clear that one proposal has
begun to gain traction, for example, because an implementation is
becoming popular, or other proposals want to rely on it, or a
standardization group (e.g., LWS WG) has expressed interest.  At
this point it is useful for the CG to document the level of
support in the CG for this proposal, as well as document (but not
necessarily resolve) opposing viewpoints. The CG should understand
that it is at this time that conversations may become tense, and
the Chairs must be sure to monitor feedback and ensure that debate
remains respectful and inclusive. If there is strong interest in
standardization, the CG should work on a standardization plan,
which might be adoption by the Linked Web Storage WG (if in scope) or some
other group at W3C or elsewhere.
